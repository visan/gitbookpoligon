While Kubernetes can dramatically simplify the task of application deployment in containers, its dynamic nature adds new complexity to monitoring the services and applications running in it, as well as, the health of the containers and orchestration infrastructure itself. Elasticsearch and Beats can help, along with Kibana of course.   
  


With the Kubernetes and Docker module in Beats, sending logs and metrics from your containerization and orchestration environment to Elasticsearch is one command away. Additionally, the Autodiscover feature in Filebeat and Metricbeat dynamically launches configurations to keep monitoring the changing environment without skipping a beat, as pods and services come and go. In this webinar, we will cover all that and more.
